## Background Math

The Nyquist Critical Frequency determines the bandwidth of the FFT algorithm. 

It can be calculated using f<sub>c</sub> = 1/2Î”t 
where the bandwith ranges from f - f<sub>c</sub> to f + f<sub>c</sub>.

These formulas and the full explanation can be found [here](https://vanhunteradams.com/FFT/FFT.html).

Based on these equations, the fastest frequency that can be detected is half the sample rate.

In our case, the robot emits a frequency of 2500 Hz and the stationary circuit emits a frequency of 5000 Hz. Therefore a sample rate of 10kHz (a max bound of 5kHz) is accepable for the stationary circuit to detect the robot beeps while a sample rate of 20kHz (a max bound of 10kHz) is more suitable for the robot to detect the stationary circuit beeps.

## Rational and Sources
The goal of our project is to mimic whale echolocation.

TODO

## Logical Structure

The code for both the stationary circuit and robot feature a interrupt service routine for creating beeps, and one main thread which samples audio using a DMA channel and computes the maximum frequency using a FFT algorithm. 

The sequence begins when the robot sends a beep. The stationary circuit detects this beep and will respond. 
This exchange happens 3 times. Each time the time between when the robot sent a beep and received the stationary beep is recorded as a time difference. If the robot does not receive a return beep from the stationary circuit within 1 second, it sends another beep. Once 3 time differences have been recorded, a median time difference is calculated. This median time difference is used to determine if the previous median time difference was smaller than the previous calculated median time difference (meaning the two circuits are closer). 

The robot will then move accordingly as described in the Program Details section of Program and Hardware Design.

## Hardware/Software Tradeoffs

### Detecting Distance

One of the major decisions we made in our design was how to simulate a whale sending out a sound and then hearing a response in order to determine their relative location. In the first iteration of our hardware design, both the stationary circuit and the robot used a speaker powered by the Pico. However, we found that the microphone was unable to detect beeps made by the speaker. We then decided to power the speaker for both circuits with the 9V battery. We also increased the audio sampling rate from 10kHz to 20kHz to account for the 5000 Hz Nyquist limit. This increased the distance the two circuits could be moved away from each other. We found that the mobile robot still sometimes struggled to detect the beeps made by the stationary circuit. Since the stationary circuit did not have to move, we decided to use an audio socket with wall speakers to increase the output of the stationary ciruit.

We also considered using ultrasonic sensors. However, we decided to use sound since we thought that would make it easier to debug (we can hear the interaction between the circuits and did not need to add an additional indicator like a LED) and our familiarity with detecting audible frequencies from the crickets lab.

### TODO
we need at least one more tradeoff
