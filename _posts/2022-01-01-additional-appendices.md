## Tasking

### Rochelle
* Wired mobile robot car for two-motor movement, speakers and mics, connections to microcontroller
* Arranged code for initial basic motor movement independent from sound detection and emission
* Debugged motor code and combined with frequency detection code
* Programmed and tested state machine with motor movement

### Lauren
* Worked on initial state machine design and created diagram
* Wrote code to generate and detect clicks
* Debugged code and wiring to move motors backwards
* Forked website template and structured pages

### Sarika
* Wrote code for the mobile robot to allow the Pico to control two motors 
* Programmed movement functions for moving in different directions
* Debugged motor code and tested with frequency detection code with Rochelle
* Programmed and tested state machine code for motor movement with Rochelle
